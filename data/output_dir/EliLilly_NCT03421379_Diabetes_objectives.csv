Objectives,Endpoints
Primary To demonstrate that 3 mg LY900018 is non-inferior to 1 mg IMG for the proportion of patients achieving treatment success from insulin-induced hypoglycemia using a non-inferiority margin of 10%,The proportion of patients achieving treatment success defined as either an increase in PG to >70 mg/dL or an increase of >20 mg/dL from nadir within 30 minutes after administration of glucagon. The nadir is defined as the minimum PG value at the time of or within 10 minutes following glucagon administration.
Secondary  To compare the safety and tolerability of 3 mg LY900018 with 1 mg IMG  To characterize the PK profile of 3 mg LY900018 compared to 1 mg IMG  To characterize the PD profile of 3 mg LY900018 compared to 1 mg IMG," SAE, TEAEs (including gastrointestinal, nasal, and non-nasal AEs), vital signs  PK parameters include AUC, Cmax, Tmax  PD parameters include BGmax and Tmax"
Exploratory  Explore the formation of anti-glucagon antibodies to glucagon  To evaluate the recovery from clinical symptoms of hypoglycemia, Presence of anti-glucagon antibodies  Hypoglycemia symptoms questionnaire
